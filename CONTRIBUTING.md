## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

Example:
```javascript
// Good
async function getTopSites() {
  try {
    const sites = await chrome.topSites.get();
    return sites.map(site => ({
      name: site.title,
      url: site.url
    }));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch top sites:', error);
    return [];
  }
}

// Avoid
function getTops() {
  return chrome.topSites.get().then(s => s.map(x => ({
    n: x.title,
    u: x.url
  })));
}
```

### CSS

- Use CSS variables for theming
- Follow BEM naming convention
- Keep selectors specific but not overly nested

Example:
```css
/* Good */
.cmd-palette-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}

.cmd-palette-item--selected {
  background-color: var(--selected-bg);
}

/* Avoid */
.palette div div.item.selected {
  background: #eee;
}
```
